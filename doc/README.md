* 3D hex mesh

> This [[`data/AbaImportAndSmooth.cub` (3.2 MB)](data/AbaImportAndSmooth.cub)] is a Cubit file of the femur mesh I was able to generate. But I generated the mesh in Ansys ICEM CFD.
> At a minimum we can use this mesh to generate an stl that is watertight as the starting point for other approaches.
